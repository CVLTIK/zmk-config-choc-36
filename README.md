This is a showcase of my custom keybinding setup for the **Corne** keyboard layout. Each layer and key press has been meticulously designed to optimize my workflow and enhance productivity. Below, you'll find an overview of the keymap layout, as well as key combinations and the functions they trigger.

ZMK Keymap for Corne Keyboard

This is the keymap configuration for a Corne Keyboard using ZMK Firmware. The layout consists of several layers that define how keys behave in different modes (e.g., normal typing, symbols, numbers, and system commands).
Layout Overview

The keymap is structured into layers:

    KeyPress Layer: Standard key presses when no modifier or special layer is active.

    SYM Layer: The symbols layer that changes certain keys to provide access to punctuation and special symbols.

    NUM Layer: Numeric keypad layer for easy access to numbers and arithmetic keys.

    MSE Layer: Mouse control layer for actions like scrolling and clicking.

    SYS Layer: System commands layer, which includes actions like unlocking or other system-specific functions.

Layer Definitions
KeyPress Layer (Default Layer)

This is the primary key layer that defines the default behavior of the keys:

    Standard Key Presses:

        Q, D, R, W, B, J, F, U, P, BACKSPACE

        Combination keys such as A (with Left GUI), S (with Left ALT), H (with Left CTRL), T (with Left SHIFT)

        Special keys like Z, X, M, C, V, K, L, ,, ., /, and SPACE

SYM Layer (Symbols Layer)

The SYM layer allows access to special characters and symbols:

    The ‚ñΩ key is used to switch between layers (transitions).

    Symbols such as {, }, !, @, #, $, %, ^, ~, and & are mapped to various keys.

    Also includes key actions like KP SUBTRACT, KP EQUAL, and other special characters like _, |, and +.

NUM Layer (Numeric Keypad)

This layer transforms certain keys into a numeric keypad, allowing easy access to numbers and basic operators:

    Includes numbers 1‚Äì9, 0, and common operations like +, -, and =.

    ‚ñΩ is used for layer transition.

MSE Layer (Mouse Layer)

The MSE (mouse) layer includes mouse actions:

    Mouse scrolling: SCRL_RIGHT, SCRL_UP, SCRL_LEFT, SCRL_DOWN

    Mouse movement: MOVE_UP, MOVE_LEFT, MOVE_RIGHT, MOVE_DOWN

    Mouse click actions: LCLK (Left Click), MCLK (Middle Click), RCLK (Right Click)

    Arrow key functions: LEFT, DOWN, UP, RIGHT

SYS Layer (System Commands)

This layer handles system-specific commands:

    studio_unlock: Unlocks certain system features.

    Key actions such as BT for Bluetooth connection controls (BT 0, BT 1, BT 2, etc.).

    Placeholder ‚ñΩ for layer transitions.

Combo Actions

Certain key combinations are mapped to specific actions, such as:

    [1, 2] ‚Üí ESC (Escape key)

    [22, 21] ‚Üí ENTER (Enter key)

    [13, 14] ‚Üí TAB (Tab key)

    [10, 9] ‚Üí BACKSPACE (Backspace key)

These combos require pressing the keys listed at the same time.
Example Breakdown of a Layer

    KeyPress Layer (Key Mapping Example):

        Key 0 is empty ('').

        Key 1 is mapped to Q.

        Key 2 is mapped to D.

        Keys like A are mapped with a modifier, e.g., {t: A, h: LEFT GUI} means A with the Left GUI key.

    SYM Layer:

        Key 1 is mapped to {t: ‚ñΩ, type: trans}, which is a transition to another layer.

        Key 2 is mapped to {, followed by Key 3 mapped to }.

Final Notes

    This configuration allows for smooth key transitions across layers, with each layer having a distinct function, such as typing, symbol input, number entry, mouse control, or system commands.

    The combo actions let you trigger special keys or shortcuts by pressing two keys simultaneously.

Feel free to adjust the key mappings based on your personal preferences!
